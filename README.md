## PowellPeralta, powered by BoardScribe


Thanks for taking the time to look over my submission, I hope you enjoy it! Make sure to check the source for a suprise!

I decieded to learn and use MeteorJS to create a CMS for this project after hearing that Blue Ion often implements custom content management solutions for their clients. It's called Boardscribe, and it allows you to add, edit, and delete posts from an easy to use management system. 

Behind the scenes, the site is powered by a mixture of technologies, including the MeteorJS Framework, Foundation 5, SASS, and a pinch of jquery for seasoning. Meteor itself is an interesting platform, allowing a bit more of a freeform approach verses MVC frameworks like Angular. It has a low barrier to entry, and rapid deployment using the *.meteor.com service is a great way to prototype. Overall, I see promise in the framework, especially as it gets closer to a 1.0 release and better docs are released. You can learn more about Meteor [here.](http://www.meteor.com/ )

Ready to explore the site? Just head [here!](http://peralta.meteor.com/ ) It may say the site is down, simply give it a few minutes to spin up the server. 

Once you're there, you can access http://www.peralta.meteor.com/login, and login to BoardScribe with the username admin, and the password test123 to begin editing content!
